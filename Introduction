Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as behavior, demographics, or purchasing patterns. It helps businesses tailor marketing strategies, personalize experiences, and improve customer retention.

üíª Tools Overview
Python
Python is a powerful programming language widely used in data science for its readability and extensive library support.

Scikit-learn (sklearn)
A machine learning library in Python that provides tools for data preprocessing, clustering, classification, and more. It‚Äôs commonly used for applying clustering algorithms like K-Means for segmentation.

Seaborn
A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It simplifies the creation of attractive and informative statistical graphics ‚Äî perfect for visualizing clusters.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow for Customer Segmentation
Data Collection:
Load customer data (e.g., purchase history, demographics).

Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Normalize or scale data (e.g., using StandardScaler)

Segmentation (Clustering):

Use clustering algorithms like K-Means from sklearn.cluster

Determine optimal number of clusters (e.g., using the Elbow Method)

Visualization:

Use Seaborn for pair plots, scatter plots, and cluster visualization
