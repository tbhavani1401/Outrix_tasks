🏡 House Price Prediction – Introduction

House price prediction is a popular machine learning project where we use historical housing data (like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location)
to estimate the selling price of a house. Using Python, we handle the dataset with Pandas, process numerical values with NumPy, and build predictive models
with Scikit-Learn. A regression algorithm (commonly Linear Regression) is trained on past data to learn the relationship between house features and their prices. 
Once trained, the model can predict prices for new houses, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate businesses make informed decisions.

🏡 Steps in House Price Prediction
1. Importing Libraries
First, we bring in important Python libraries:
Pandas → for handling datasets (loading, cleaning, filtering).
NumPy → for numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn (sklearn) → for splitting data, training models, and evaluating performance.

2. Loading the Dataset
The dataset usually comes as a CSV file with details like:
Area (in square feet)
Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Location
Price (target we want to predict)
We load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and check the first few rows to understand the structure.

3. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values: Remove or fill empty values.
Selecting features (X): Choose independent variables (like area, bedrooms, bathrooms).
Target variable (y): The price column, which we want to predict.

4. Splitting Dataset
We divide the dataset into:
Training set (80%) → used to teach the model.
Testing set (20%) → used to check how well the model performs.

5. Training the Model
We use Linear Regression (a simple and effective algorithm).
The model tries to learn a relationship between features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms) and price.

6. Making Predictions
After training, we use the model to predict prices of houses from the test set.
For each test house, the model estimates a price based on learned patterns.

7. Evaluating the Model
We check accuracy using metrics like:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures how far predictions are from actual prices (smaller is better).
R-squared Score (R²): Tells how well the model explains variation in prices (closer to 1 is better).

8. Predicting New House Price
Finally, we can give the model new input (like a house with 2500 sq ft, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms).
The model outputs a predicted price for that house.
